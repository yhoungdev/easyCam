# easyCam
a small javascript library which you  can use to access your webCam which just a singleline of code 
## HOW TO USE IT 
most people find it difficult or impossible to access their fore camera, web cam with vanilla js, while some people 
know it possible but see it as a very complex and diificilt stuff.
### So i decided to create this small library for them
the library is very easy to use 
to access your webcam with the library, what you just need to do is call the function web().cam()
the web() takes in on function paameter which is the video tag
for example 
web('video').cam()
and this will will access your webcam for you 

##NOTE
your HTML document must have the <video></video> cause that is what your js use to access your webCam
